          <h3>I am Kevin:</h3>
          <p>
            Father, husband, software engineer, geek, and inquisitive explorer charting a course through the vast expanse of life.
            Originally from southwest Florida, I've been based in Austin since 2010.
            I have a penchant for BBQ, good beer, the Florida Gators, and the timeless allure of pumpkins. As well as collecting
            vintage computers and devices that hold nostalgic significance or mark meaningful moments in technology history.

          <h3>Science, Space, and Building Systems</h3>
          <p>
            I studied Space Science and Astrophysics at Florida Tech, and discovered that I had a passion for programming.
            That path became a long software career where I've built and led a wide variety of projects in multiple industries.

          <h3>Voyager Mindset</h3>
          <p>
            I have a deep-seated curiosity about the universe and a passion for learning across diverse fields.
            As an enthusiast of space, science, and technology, I enjoy exploring the mysteries of the cosmos and the principles that govern it.
            Born at the same time the twin <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/">Voyager spacecraft</a> embarked on their Grand Tour of the solar system, I feel a sort of kinship with them.
            Their journey into interstellar space inspires my own pursuit of knowledge and exploration.

          <h3>Open Web and Technology</h3>
          <p>
            I've maintained a personal web site at <a href="https://kevinharder.com" title="KevinHarder.com" rel="self">KevinHarder.com</a> for over 20 years, where I occasionally share my thoughts.
            I am interested in exploring ways to evolve the internet from isolated islands and gated social platforms into a more interconnected, open frontier.
            I'm having a blast exploring the new world of agentic AI.

          <h3>Personal Side Quests</h3>
          <p>
            I like contributing to open-source projects. Under the <a href="https://harder.dev" title="Harder.DEV">Harder.DEV</a> banner,
            I offer consulting services and work on various side projects. One is a free community puzzle exchange at <a href="https://austinpuzzles.com" target="_blank" title="Austin Puzzles"> AustinPuzzles.com</a>,
            bringing people together one piece at a time.
